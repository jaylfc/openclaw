 * the same user. This prevents a compromised sub-agent from poisoning the
 * main store's credentials.
 *
 * Serialization: uses `updateAuthProfileStoreWithLock` so the read-modify-
 * write takes the main-store lock and cannot race with other main-store
 * writers (e.g. `updateAuthProfileStoreWithLock` in other flows, CLI-sync).
 *
 * Intentionally best-effort: a failure here must not fail the caller's
 * refresh, since the credential has already been persisted to the agent's
 * own store and returned to the requester.

 *   1. If one side carries identity metadata (accountId or email) and the
 *      other does not, refuse — we have no evidence they match.
 *   2. If both sides carry identity, a shared field must match (accountId
 *      wins over email when both present). If the two sides carry identity
 *      in non-overlapping fields (one has only accountId, the other only
 *      email), refuse.
 *   3. If neither side carries identity, return true: no evidence of
 *      mismatch and provider equality is checked separately by the caller.
 *
 * The previous permissive behaviour (fall back to `true` whenever a strict
 * comparison could not be made) was unsafe: a sub-agent whose refreshed
 * credential lacked identity metadata could overwrite a known-account main
 * credential that had it, allowing cross-account poisoning through the
 * mirror path.

/**
 * Identity gate used for both directions of credential copy:
 *   - mirror (sub-agent refresh -> main agent store)
 *   - adopt (main agent store -> sub-agent store)
 *
 * Rule: allow the copy iff
 *   1. no positive identity mismatch — if both sides expose the same
 *      identity field (accountId or email), the values must match, AND
 *   2. the incoming credential carries at least as much identity
 *      evidence as the existing one — if existing has accountId/email,
 *      incoming must carry the same field, AND
 *   3. when both sides carry identity but in non-overlapping fields
 *      (existing has only accountId, incoming has only email, or vice
 *      versa) we cannot positively prove the same account and the copy
 *      is refused.
 *
 * Accepts:
 *   - matching accountId (positive match on strongest field)
 *   - matching email when accountId is absent on both sides
 *   - neither side carries identity (no evidence of mismatch)
 *   - existing has no identity, incoming has identity (UPGRADE: adds
 *     the marker without dropping anything)
 *
 * Refuses:
 *   - mismatching accountId or email on a shared field (CWE-284 core)
 *   - incoming drops an identity field present on existing (regression
 *     that would later let a wrong-account peer pass this gate)
 *   - non-overlapping fields (no comparable positive match)
 *
 * Design note: this is a single unified rule for both copy directions.
 * The rule is deliberately one-sided because "existing" is whatever is
 * about to be overwritten and "incoming" is the new data — the
 * constraint is the same regardless of whether existing is main or sub.
